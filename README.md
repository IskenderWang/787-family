# 787-family
787 family for FlightGear, the result of succeeding at my attempt to merge legoboyvdlp's abandoned -9 with the fgaddon -8 in active development

This is NOT the official home of the 787-8 for Flightgear – you can find that here:

http://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/fgaddon/HEAD/tree/trunk/Aircraft/787-8/

After gitorious closed down and former maintainer Omega95 retired, islandmonkey created a Github repo, which was subsequently merged into FGAddon.

IMPORTANT: To have everything working, make sure you rename the folder to 787-8 – all the links in the code to the 787-8 directory have yet to be changed
