# 787-family
Boeing 787 family for FlightGear: the result of a successful attempt to merge [Jonathan Redpath's abandoned -9](https://github.com/legoboyvdlp/787-9) with the [FGAddon 787-8](http://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/fgaddon/HEAD/tree/trunk/Aircraft/787-8/).

This is the official home of the unified 787 family, based on the two models listed above.

After gitorious closed down and former maintainer Omega95 retired, islandmonkey created a Github repo, which was subsequently merged into FGAddon. Now, IskenderWang and Marsdolphin, among others, are collaborating on a project that aims to improve the quality of the 787 and several of its variants.

This package contains the following models:
-------

- 787-8 (RR Trent)
- 787-9 (RR Trent and GEnx)

IMPORTANT: To have everything working, make sure the folder is named 787-family (no -master after if downloading zip)!

NOTE: The autopilot now fully operates on [Octal450's excellent ITAF system](https://github.com/Octal450/IT-AUTOFLIGHT) – see [here](http://wiki.flightgear.org/IT-AUTOFLIGHT) for more information.
