# 787-family
Boeing 787 family for FlightGear: the result of succeeding at my attempt to merge [Jonathan Redpath's abandoned -9](https://github.com/legoboyvdlp/787-9) with the fgaddon -8 in active development

This is NOT the official home of the 787-8 for FlightGear – you can find that here:

http://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/fgaddon/HEAD/tree/trunk/Aircraft/787-8/

fter gitorious closed down and former maintainer Omega95 retired, islandmonkey created a Github repo, which was subsequently merged into FGAddon. Now, IskenderWang and Marsdolphin, among others, have collaborated on a project to make the 787 become an high quality aircraft.

This package contains the following models:
-------

- 787-8 (RR Trent)
- 787-9 (RR Trent and GEnx)
