After gitorious closed down and former maintainer Omega95 retired, islandmonkey created a Github repo, which was subsequently merged into FGAddon.
Now, IskenderWang and Marsdolphin, among others, are collaborating on a project that aims to improve the quality of several aircraft in the 787 family.

This package contains the following models:
-------

-787-8
-787-9
